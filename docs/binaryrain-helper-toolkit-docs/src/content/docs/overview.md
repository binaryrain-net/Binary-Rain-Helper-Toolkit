Welcome to the Binary Rain Helper Toolkit documentation. We provide a collection of utilities and components designed to simplify common development tasks and streamline your workflow. Whether you're building applications, automating processes, or implementing DevOps practices, this is the right place for you.

Our motto is to **remove boilerplate code** and **ensure consistency** in our own development process. We aim to share our tools and templates with the community, so you can benefit from our experience.

## Toolkits
Our toolkits mostly build on top of great existing libraries. The are not designed to replace them, but rather to enhance or simplify their usage. In our development process we have often generated bloated boilerplate code that got duplicated throughout multiple projects. We aim to remove this boilerplate code and ensure that our desired functions work as intended and handle errors properly.

## Templates
In addition to our toolkits, we also provide our customized templates for instant ready-to-go development. These templates are designed to help us get started quickly and efficiently, allowing us to focus on building applications without getting bogged down in repetitive setup tasks.
